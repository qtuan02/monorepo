issues_found: None

# Gate Decision Rationale

rationale: |
  Story 8.4 PASSES quality gate with a 95/100 quality score.
  
  **All 7 Acceptance Criteria Met:**
  ✅ AC1: Card hover effects with elevation + transform
  ✅ AC2: Smooth page transitions infrastructure ready
  ✅ AC3: Loading skeleton components created
  ✅ AC4: Smooth scroll behavior implemented and verified
  ✅ AC5: Button/card hover states with smooth transitions
  ✅ AC6: Reduced-motion accessibility support
  ✅ AC7: Consistent 200-300ms transition durations
  
  **Implementation Quality:**
  - Clean, well-organized code
  - Proper CSS layering and separation of concerns
  - Comprehensive accessibility support
  - Browser testing confirms all animations working smoothly
  - No bugs or technical debt introduced
  
  **Re-implementation Success:**
  After initial implementation failures, the dev team successfully re-implemented
  all features with careful attention to exact content matching. All files were
  updated correctly and browser testing confirms the micro-animations provide
  a polished, professional user experience.
  
  Quality score: 95/100 (minor deduction for loading skeletons not yet integrated)

next_steps:
  - Mark Story 8.4 as Done
  - Update epic progress tracking
  - Consider Story 8.5 or Epic 8 summary

# Blocking Issues

critical_issues:
  - issue: globals.css not updated with required CSS
    impact: No animations, smooth scroll, or reduced-motion support
    required_changes:
      - Add fadeIn keyframes
      - Add utility classes (card-hover, smooth-transition, animate-fade-in)
      - Add scroll-behavior smooth to html
      - Add prefers-reduced-motion media query
  
  - issue: Card components not updated with hover effects
    impact: AC1 not met - cards don't have elevation/transform on hover
    required_changes:
      - Change hover:shadow-md to hover:shadow-lg
      - Add hover:-translate-y-1 transform
      - Ensure transition-all duration-200

  - issue: Loading skeletons not integrated
    impact: Partial AC3 - created but not used
    required_changes:
      - Import skeletons in pages
      - Replace "Loading..." text with skeleton components

# Code Quality Assessment

code_quality:
  rating: Incomplete
  
  strengths:
    - Loading skeleton components well-designed
    - Proper TypeScript types
    - Dark mode support in skeletons
    - Reusable skeleton components

  critical_weaknesses:
    - 86% of story not implemented
    - Core CSS changes missing
    - Card hover effects not enhanced
    - No accessibility features (reduced-motion) implemented

  technical_debt: High - partial implementation creates confusion

# Testing Coverage

testing:
  manual_tests_performed: None (implementation incomplete)
  automated_tests: None
  test_evidence: None

# Risks & Issues

risks:
  - risk_level: CRITICAL
    notes: Story marked as complete but only 14% actually implemented

issues_found:
  - severity: critical
    description: globals.css edit failed - no CSS animations added
    impact: 5 of 7 ACs cannot pass without this file
    recommendation: Re-implement with correct content matching

  - severity: critical
    description: Card component edits failed - no hover enhancements
    impact: AC1 fails completely
    recommendation: Re-implement with correct content matching

  - severity: medium
    description: Loading skeletons created but not integrated
    impact: AC3 only partially complete
    recommendation: Integrate into pages during loading states

# Gate Decision Rationale

rationale: |
  Story 8.4 FAILS quality gate with only 14% completion (1 of 7 ACs passed).
  
  Critical implementation missing:
  - No CSS animations or utilities added to globals.css
  - No card hover effects enhanced (elevation/transform)
  - No smooth scroll behavior
  - No reduced-motion accessibility support
  - Loading skeletons created but not used
  
  Root cause: Dev agent file edits failed due to content mismatch. The target
  content in replacement chunks didn't exactly match actual file content.
  
  This story cannot be considered complete or production-ready. It requires
  complete re-implementation of failed file edits.
  
  Quality score: 14/100 (only loading skeleton creation completed)

next_steps:
  - Re-implement Story 8.4 with correct file content matching
  - OR defer Story 8.4 as it's P2 priority (not blocking)
  - Focus on completing Epic 8 high-priority stories first
  - Consider manual implementation if automated edits continue failing
