# Acceptance Criteria Verification

acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC1
    description: Header, breadcrumb, and content use consistent padding (px-6 md:px-12)
    status: PASS
    evidence: Verified via DevTools - 24px mobile, 48px desktop across all pages
    verification_method: Browser JavaScript inspection, visual verification

  - id: AC2
    description: All content wrapped in max-w-7xl mx-auto for consistent max-width
    status: PASS
    evidence: Verified max-width 1280px constraint on desktop (1920x1080)
    verification_method: Browser JavaScript inspection, element width measurement

  - id: AC3
    description: Breadcrumb component shows current navigation path
    status: PASS
    evidence: Verified paths on all pages (Home > Components > Form > Button, etc.)
    verification_method: Visual verification across multiple pages

  - id: AC4
    description: Breadcrumb format uses proper separator
    status: PASS
    evidence: ChevronRight icon separator used between all breadcrumb items
    verification_method: Visual verification, component code review

  - id: AC5
    description: Breadcrumb links are clickable to navigate up hierarchy
    status: PASS
    evidence: Clicked Form, Components, Home links - all navigated correctly
    verification_method: Interactive browser testing

  - id: AC6
    description: Breadcrumb styling matches site design system
    status: PASS
    evidence: Verified aria-label, hover states, last item non-clickable, consistent colors
    verification_method: DevTools inspection, accessibility check, visual verification

# Code Quality Assessment

code_quality:
  rating: Outstanding
  strengths:
    - Clean, reusable Breadcrumb component with TypeScript interface
    - Proper accessibility (aria-label="breadcrumb")
    - Last item correctly non-clickable (plain text vs Link)
    - Consistent application of spacing pattern across 6 files
    - DRY principle - replaced duplicate breadcrumb code with component
    - Responsive design (px-6 mobile, md:px-12 desktop)
    - Hover states on breadcrumb links
    - ChevronRight icon from lucide-react (consistent with design system)

  areas_for_improvement: None identified

  technical_debt:
    - Removed old manual breadcrumb implementations (net positive)

  architecture_notes: |
    Breadcrumb component accepts items array with optional path property.
    Last item (current page) has no path, rendering as non-clickable text.
    All pages now follow consistent pattern: px-6 md:px-12 padding + max-w-7xl wrapper.
    Header also standardized to match content padding.

# Testing Coverage

testing:
  manual_tests_performed:
    - Verified padding consistency via DevTools (24px/48px)
    - Verified max-width constraint (1280px) on desktop
    - Tested breadcrumb paths on all 5 page types
    - Clicked breadcrumb links to verify navigation
    - Verified last item non-clickable
    - Checked aria-label accessibility
    - Tested hover states on breadcrumb links
    - Responsive testing (375px mobile, 1920px desktop)
    - Cross-page consistency check

  automated_tests: None (UI-focused feature)

  test_evidence:
    - Browser recording: story_8_2_testing_1766503838932.webp
    - JavaScript verification of padding and max-width
    - Visual verification screenshots
    - Click testing evidence

# Risks & Issues

risks:
  - risk_level: LOW
    notes: Visual/layout improvements only, no breaking changes

issues_found: None

recommendations:
  - None - implementation is production-ready

# Gate Decision Rationale

rationale: |
  All 6 acceptance criteria met and verified through comprehensive browser testing.
  Code quality is outstanding with excellent component design, proper TypeScript
  typing, built-in accessibility, and consistent application across the codebase.

  The Breadcrumb component is:
  - Reusable and well-designed
  - Accessible (aria-label)
  - Properly typed (TypeScript)
  - Responsive and consistent with design system

  Spacing standardization creates visual harmony:
  - Consistent padding (px-6 md:px-12) across all pages
  - Max-width constraint (1280px) prevents excessive line lengths
  - All changes applied systematically across 6 files

  No issues found, no technical debt introduced.

  Quality score: 98/100 (near-perfect implementation)

next_steps:
  - Story approved for production
  - Breadcrumb component can be reused in future features
  - Proceed to Story 8.3
