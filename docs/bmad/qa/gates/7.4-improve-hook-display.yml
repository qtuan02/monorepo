# Acceptance Criteria Verification

acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC1
    description: Hook detail page shows usage example first
    status: PASS
    evidence: Usage Example section appears before Parameters section on all hooks with demos
    verification_method: Browser testing on use-debounce, use-copy-to-clipboard, use-is-mobile

  - id: AC2
    description: Example demonstrates hook in action (live demo)
    status: PASS
    evidence: |
      - use-debounce: Interactive input showing immediate vs debounced values
      - use-copy-to-clipboard: Copy button with visual feedback
      - use-is-mobile: Responsive detection that updates on window resize
    verification_method: Interactive browser testing with user actions

  - id: AC3
    description: Code for the example shown below
    status: PASS
    evidence: Example Code section consistently placed below Live Demo
    verification_method: Visual inspection across multiple hook pages

  - id: AC4
    description: Clear, runnable code snippets
    status: PASS
    evidence: Syntax highlighting, line numbers, and functional copy button present
    verification_method: Browser testing, copy button functionality verified

# Code Quality Assessment

code_quality:
  rating: Excellent
  strengths:
    - Clean registry pattern for extensibility
    - Proper TypeScript typing with HookExample interface
    - Graceful degradation for hooks without demos
    - Reuses existing CodeViewer component
    - Minimal code duplication
    - Good separation of concerns

  areas_for_improvement:
    - Import organization in hook-examples.ts could be cleaner (interleaved comments)
    - Consider lazy loading demo components for performance

  technical_debt: None identified

  architecture_notes: |
    Registry pattern is appropriate and extensible. Vite ?raw imports are
    a clean solution for displaying source code. Optional demo rendering
    via conditional check prevents breaking existing hooks.

# Testing Coverage

testing:
  manual_tests_performed:
    - Verified all 4 acceptance criteria via browser
    - Tested 4 hooks with demos (debounce, localStorage, clipboard, isMobile)
    - Verified graceful degradation on use-timeout (no demo)
    - Tested code copy functionality
    - Verified responsive behavior (mobile detection)
    - Tested persistence (localStorage across page reloads)

  automated_tests: None (UI-focused feature)

  test_evidence:
    - Browser recording: qa_verification_7_4_1766467699493.webp
    - Screenshots: use_debounce_immediate, use_copy_to_clipboard_feedback, use_timeout_final_check

# Risks & Issues

risks:
  - risk_level: LOW
    notes: Simple, well-scoped implementation with no breaking changes

issues_found: []

recommendations:
  - Consider adding usage demos for remaining 10 hooks
  - Document registry pattern for future contributors
  - Consider auto-generating simple demos from hook signatures (future enhancement)

# Gate Decision Rationale

rationale: |
  All acceptance criteria met with comprehensive browser verification.
  Code quality is excellent with clean architecture and proper TypeScript usage.
  Implementation includes graceful degradation and reuses existing components.
  No breaking changes or technical debt introduced.

  Minor improvement opportunity exists in import organization, but this is
  cosmetic and does not impact functionality or maintainability.

  Quality score: 95/100 (deducted 5 points for minor code organization)

next_steps:
  - Story approved for production
  - Consider creating follow-up story for adding more hook demos
  - Document registry pattern in architecture docs
