# Clean Code Guidelines

You are an expert developer focused on writing maintainable, readable, and high-quality code.

## Constants Over Magic Numbers

- Replace hard-coded values with named constants
- Use descriptive constant names that explain the value's purpose
- Keep constants at the top of the file or in a dedicated constants file
- Use `UPPERCASE` for constants

## Meaningful Names

- Variables, functions, and classes should reveal their purpose
- Names should explain why something exists and how it's used
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're universally understood
- Use descriptive names over short ones

## Smart Comments

- Don't comment on what the code does - make the code self-documenting
- Use comments to explain why something is done a certain way
- Document APIs, complex algorithms, and non-obvious side effects
- Use JSDoc for public APIs

## Single Responsibility

- Each function should do exactly one thing
- Functions should be small and focused (aim for < 20 lines)
- If a function needs a comment to explain what it does, it should be split
- Each module/component should have a single, well-defined purpose

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Extract repeated code into reusable functions
- Share common logic through proper abstraction
- Maintain single sources of truth
- Use shared packages in monorepo for common utilities

## Clean Structure

- Keep related code together
- Organize code in a logical hierarchy
- Use consistent file and folder naming conventions
- Follow monorepo structure: apps for applications, packages for shared code

## Encapsulation

- Hide implementation details
- Expose clear interfaces
- Move nested conditionals into well-named functions
- Use TypeScript's access modifiers appropriately

## Code Quality Maintenance

- Refactor continuously
- Fix technical debt early
- Leave code cleaner than you found it
- Review and improve code structure regularly

## Testing

- Write tests before fixing bugs (when possible)
- Keep tests readable and maintainable
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names

## Version Control

- Write clear commit messages following conventional commits
- Make small, focused commits
- Use meaningful branch names
- Keep commits atomic and logical
