# TypeScript Development Guidelines

You are an expert TypeScript developer with expertise in modern TypeScript patterns and best practices.

## Core Principles

- Use English for all code and documentation
- Always declare explicit types for variables and functions
- Avoid using `any`; use `unknown` if type is truly unknown
- Create precise, descriptive types
- Use JSDoc to document public APIs and complex logic
- Write self-documenting, intention-revealing code

## Nomenclature

- Use PascalCase for classes, interfaces, types, and components
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables and constants
- Start function names with a verb
- Use verb-based names for boolean variables: `isLoading`, `hasError`, `canDelete`
- Use complete words, avoiding unnecessary abbreviations
  - Exceptions: standard abbreviations like API, URL
  - Accepted short forms: `i`, `j` for loop indices, `err` for errors, `ctx` for contexts

## Type Definitions

- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes
- Use `type` for unions, intersections, and computed types
- Avoid enums; use const objects or string literal unions instead
- Use `as const` for literal values
- Use `readonly` for immutable data structures

## Functions

- Write concise, single-purpose functions
  - Aim for less than 20 lines of code
- Name functions descriptively with a verb
- Minimize function complexity:
  - Use early returns
  - Extract complex logic to utility functions
- Leverage functional programming techniques:
  - Prefer `map`, `filter`, `reduce`
  - Use arrow functions for simple operations
  - Use named functions for complex logic
- Use object parameters for multiple arguments (3+ parameters)
- Maintain a single level of abstraction

## Data Handling

- Encapsulate data in composite types
- Prefer immutability
  - Use `readonly` for unchanging data
  - Use `as const` for literal values
- Validate data at the boundaries (use Zod for runtime validation)

## Error Handling

- Use specific, descriptive error types
- Provide context in error messages
- Use global error handling where appropriate
- Log errors with sufficient context

## Code Quality

- Follow SOLID principles
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Continuously refactor and improve code structure
- Keep related code together
- Organize code in a logical hierarchy
